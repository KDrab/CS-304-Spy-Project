Project Accomplishments:

Our project provides a GUI for management of a game system. Players can log in and log out of 
our system after registering using their email, a selected username, and password, stored in 
our database. After setting up a player account, a user is able to create a character selectable
from the 3 classes: Businessman, Politician, and Spy. Each character is given 2 actions that can 
be selected. A list of a player's characters is given on each user's homepage which can be 
selected independently from one another. Finally, players can see who is on the winning team,
and who is on the losing team.
