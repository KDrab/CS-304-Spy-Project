1. Selection and projection query - DONE
every time data is displayed

2. Join query - DONE
checking character type when a character is selected

3. Division query - TODO
IDEA: check if a player has done all the actions, this is an accomplishment in the game

4. Aggregation query - DONE
Admin page shows aggregate data of each team

5. Nested aggregation with group-by - IN PROG
LeaderBoard does this but according to the demo page the user needs to choose to get the min or max, not both immediately. Solution is to create two buttons that display popups, one displays the team in first, or the team in last (by average level of members).

6. Delete operation - TODO
Allow player to delete character

7. Update operation - DONE
Signup button does this, as one example.

8. Graphical user interface - IN PROG/DONE
